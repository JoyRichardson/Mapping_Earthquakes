# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
You are a new Data Visualization Specialist for the Disaster Reporting Network, a non-profit that provides data-driven stories for disasters around the world.  The company wants to build insightful data visualizations with interactive features.  Basil, the head of team, hopes to make earthquake maps that are informative and easy-to-use on desktops and mobile devices, which will generate positive buzz.  Sadhana is your mentor and will help with the website and global application development. 

## Resources
Software(s): JavaScript ES6, Leaflet 1.6, Mapbox API, HTML, CSS, and Visual Studio Code 1.57.1

## Purpose
We want to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days, using a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website, retrieving geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes, finishing with adding the data to a map.  We will use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data and the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Summary
We created maps to represent data from the last seven days for major and all earthquakes, plus the tetonic plates.  We also created three overlays: street, satellite and dark views.  Each of these toggled so that users can select their preferences.  Last, we created markers and popups related to magnitude and location.
